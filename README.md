#  Wow! This is a Read Me file!
You are supposed to read it, and I am supposed to format it. Well, *supposed to*. Like apparently the greater than sign creates a blockquote? What does that mean? Let's find out! 
> This is a blockquote! ![The more you know!](TMYK.jfif) I bet you can add other funny things to this too! Like ordered and unordered lists! 
>
1. I was wrong
2. It doesn't work like that
3. I bet if I put a blockquote before each list entry I might get it to work but it wouldn't be in the same blockquote
> 4. This is what I mean!
> 5. I was wrong once again! It does make it in the same blockquote! 
Now for the unordered list.
Well, before that it looks like if you don't put a greater than symbol to close the blockquote it won't  separate it. Make sure to do that!
>
Now for real, the unordered list!
- This is the first thing!
- This is the second, and it seems to make bulletpoints!
- Quite fitting for a unordered list.
Looks like it doesn't separate this unordered list part as well. You most likely just need to double space it.

Yep, you need an empty space. Alright, now for the "Horizontal Rule"!

Wow! That made a massive difference. It made what looks like a header, but technically isn't. Let's try it one more time with no words beforehand!

Cool stuff! Now for the last two basic things. I tried the more you know graphic earlier and it didn't work, so let's try another photo one last time! ![This means it didn't work.](Win.jpg)
If I had to guess it's because they aren't in the same folder. I'll have to keep this in mind for future Readme files!

Lastly, a link! [This should be an embedded message!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck0LO6b6OQc&list=PLj6g5m5v712xVRnQQjLSofImjL7k3FC5M&index=20) Here is another [one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Cool stuff!

If I double enter and leave a line break it looks like I can separate messages, whereas it won't work otherwise. This is a terrible segway to the **EXTENDED SYNTAX!**

This should make a table!
| Syntax | Description |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |

Wow it totally worked! Now to customize it.
| ~~Table of Contents~~ Table of Tables |
| -------------|
| This is where I can start putting a bunch of text! [^1]
| This makes a new entry on the table! I would put an emoji here, but i apparently don't have any.
| Same goes for highlights and subscripts. Looks like some of the advanced features aren't in visual studio, or the commands are different here than in the guide I used.

Alright, that should be everything that I can do! I can also inject code, but I don't really have any code I want to inject, so here is my Readme file!
